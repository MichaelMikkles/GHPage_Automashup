Track Selection: Choosing specific parts (e.g., vocals, instrumentals) of the songs to be used in the mashup. Mashup Techniques: Implementing algorithms to synchronize beats, adjust tempo and pitch, and align musical phases between the selected tracks using libraries like pyrubberband and pyloudnorm. Output: Generating the final mashup audio file. The notebook provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different mashup strategies and parameters. You can customize the input songs, track selections, and mashup techniques to create your unique mashups. Key Features: Automated analysis and preprocessing of musical tracks. Flexible selection of song components for mashup creation. Multiple mashup techniques for beat synchronization, pitch adjustment, and phase alignment. Easy-to-use interface for experimentation and customization. How does it work? Given several songs, our app uses state-of-the-art tools to separate the sources of the songs and then to reunite them to create a new song. Examples of mashups realized with the app Audio: Hi-Q - My Sweetie Went Away Your browser does not support the audio element. Audio: Jewel - Ein sonniger Tag mit dir Your browser does not support the audio element.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#automashup","text":"The process involves: Preprocessing: Extracting key features from input songs, such as beats, downbeats, segments, and key signatures using the allin1 library.
