# AutoMashup

The process involves:

Preprocessing: Extracting key features from input songs, such as beats, downbeats, segments, and key signatures using the allin1 library.
Track Selection: Choosing specific parts (e.g., vocals, instrumentals) of the songs to be used in the mashup.
Mashup Techniques: Implementing algorithms to synchronize beats, adjust tempo and pitch, and align musical phases between the selected tracks using libraries like pyrubberband and pyloudnorm.
Output: Generating the final mashup audio file.
The notebook provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different mashup strategies and parameters. You can customize the input songs, track selections, and mashup techniques to create your unique mashups.

Key Features:

Automated analysis and preprocessing of musical tracks.
Flexible selection of song components for mashup creation.
Multiple mashup techniques for beat synchronization, pitch adjustment, and phase alignment.
Easy-to-use interface for experimentation and customization.



### How does it work?

Given several songs, our app uses state-of-the-art tools to separate the sources of the songs and then to reunite them to create a new song.
