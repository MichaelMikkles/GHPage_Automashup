# AutoMashup

### A workflow app which generates mashups

![Animation](./images/animation.gif)

Hello there! We're a group of students who worked to develop an application that aims to create mashups automatically.

### How does it work?

Given several songs, our app uses state-of-the-art tools to separate the sources of the songs and then to reunite them to create a new song.

## Examples of mashups realized with the app

## Tutorial

#### Import and preprocess songs

Browse through the files on your computer to import the songs of your choice.

Trigger preprocessing to add your song to the list of songs. This will take a while...

Once it's done, your song will be added to the list, along with information about its BPM and key.

#### Track Workflow

First, add your 'Track' blocks and choose the songs you want to mix using the elevator.

Then, add a 'Mixer' block and choose your mashup technique.

Now, link your 'Track' blocks to your 'Mixer' block by selecting the vocals or instruments of your choice for each input.
