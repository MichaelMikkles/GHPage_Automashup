This notebook demonstrates an automated approach to creating music mashups. It leverages various libraries and techniques to analyze, process, and combine different musical tracks. The process involves:

1. **Preprocessing:** Extracting key features from input songs, such as beats, downbeats, segments, and key signatures using the `allin1` library.
2. **Track Selection:** Choosing specific parts (e.g., vocals, instrumentals) of the songs to be used in the mashup.
3. **Mashup Techniques:** Implementing algorithms to synchronize beats, adjust tempo and pitch, and align musical phases between the selected tracks using libraries like `pyrubberband` and `pyloudnorm`.
4. **Output:** Generating the final mashup audio file.

The notebook provides a flexible framework for experimenting with different mashup strategies and parameters. You can customize the input songs, track selections, and mashup techniques to create your unique mashups.

**Key Features:**

* Automated analysis and preprocessing of musical tracks.
* Flexible selection of song components for mashup creation.
* Multiple mashup techniques for beat synchronization, pitch adjustment, and phase alignment.
* Easy-to-use interface for experimentation and customization.
